# Show Off

Showing off one's work has always been important. From grade school to college, teachers have always been saying, ‘You won't get full credit unless you show your work.’ As annoying as that was growing up, it is an important lesson to learn throughout your life. Arguably, in the tech career space, it is more important than ever before. While GitHub is a great place to show off code, plots, and a thorough thought process, it does not appeal to a non-technical audience. Luckily for many of us, there are tons of online templates for online portfolios and websites. [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes) is one of those templates. It is the template that you are reading on now. By simply following the instructions on the Minimal Mistakes GitHub Repo and making a few unique changes, it is incredibly easy to set one up. 

## Getting Started
To get started, head over to the [Minimal Mistakes website](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes)  or the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) and familiarize yourself with the template theme to make sure it is the one you want. Due to the vast amount of templated themes out there, I would recommend looking around at other themes to make sure this is the one you want. 
You can choose three different ways to install the Minimal Mistakes theme. 
1.	Gem-Based Method
2.	Remote Theme Method
3.	Forking or Directly Copying Method

I chose the Forking or Directly Copying Method because that was what I was most familiar with, and I had already made the repository for my GitHub page previously. For those who are just getting started, I would recommend this method as well.  Once a copy of the Minimal Mistakes GitHub repository is on your local, it is imported to name your repository ‘username.github.io’. This will be the URL to your portfolio.

## Basic Changes
Once your GitHub Pages Repo is created, a few personal changes need to be made to make your website yours. 
The first step is to replace the stock image with an image of yourself in the repository at ```/assets/images/``` 
The second step is to update the ```_config.yml``` file with your information. In the ```Site Settings``` section of the file, I updated the ```title```, ```name```, ```description```, and ```url``` values. In the ```Site Author``` section of the file, I updated every single label. Updating this section is very important because it is what changes the values for the author profile you see on the left side of the screen.

Push these changes up to your GitHub repository, and Congratulations! You now have a website to create your portfolio. Now the real fun begins. It is now time to personalize your portfolio with posts, blogs, and information about yourself. 

## Personalization

### Pages
Any portfolio is not complete without a resume. I created my resume on a page to make it stand out vs the rest of my posts. To do that, create another top level folder named ```_pages``` and place a markdown file(.md) containing your resume inside of it. A markdown uses markup language for formatting. Markdown is commonly used across the coding community, and if you are unfamiliar with it, I would suggest looking up a Markdown tutorial on YouTube. To format the page within your portfolio a few values needed to be added to the top of the page. As seen below, I am adding a ```permalink```, ```title```, and setting to show the author profile on the left side of the page.

Pages don’t only have to be resumes. They can be anything you want. I have seen examples of embedded YouTube videos and links to third-party websites. To have your posts show up on your home screen, you need to add the following code to the bottom of the ```_cofig.yml``` file.

### Posts
Posts are like blogs. They can be used just like blogs on Medium or Articles on LinkedIn. I will mainly use mine to write about major career experiences and blog about personal projects that I am working on. As of the writing of this blog, I currently have a blog about a project I did in 2021 called ‘My Golf Data, Storage and Entry’. 
To add a post, you will need to write your blog in another markdown file. Place the markdown file in the ```_posts``` folder with a file name convention of ```YYYY-MM-DD-Your-Blog-Title.md```. This will allow your post to appear on your main page. Pro Tip: you can back date blogs that you have written in the past, and they will show up in order of your date that you put in the file name.  

### Theme Skin
The last basic personalization you can make is to set the skin for your portfolio. This sets the color theme for your page. You can see examples of the different themes in the Minimal Mistakes GitHub ReadMe. To change the skin, go back your ```_config.yml``` file and find the ```Minimal_mistakes_skin``` value in the ```theme``` section. All of the different skin colors will be listed. I chose the ‘dark’ skin because I am team dark mode on all of my devices. 

## 
And there you have it. With all of these simple steps and a little playing around with some settings you can set up a very simple online portfolio to show off your work to the world.
